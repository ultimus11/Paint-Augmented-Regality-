# About Video:-
Today we used finger Gestures and mouse clicks to draw in Microsoft Paint application.

We used OpenCV object tracking for two objects (fingers).

We used Discriminative Correlation Filter with Channel and Spatial Reliability.

You can also try to implement the MOSSE (Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error) tracker algorithm.

I found that with practice we can draw better drawings with Augmented Reality.

If you compare this video with https://youtu.be/2oIGuq-uhkQ then you will find that the noise in object tracking is explicitly reduced as I used CSRT instead of mean shift algorithm.

Use test5_clicks.py for clicks and drawing
